      No, I am fine with Shea. Luckily enough it works for either gender, so I
      don't need to change my name unlike most trans people.
    question: Are you going to change your name?
  - answer: >-
      I would respectfully ask that you use female pronouns for me, such as
      "she", "her", and "hers". I understand this is hard for people who have
      known me a long time, so I won't take any offense as long as you're
      trying. I may give you a gentle reminder, but there's no need to have it
      be a thing any bigger than that.
    question: What pronouns should I use for you?
  - answer: '42'
    question: 'What''s the answer to life, the universe, and everything?'
