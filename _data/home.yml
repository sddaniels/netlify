  ## A note for my friends and family


  Hi! I’d like to share something very personal and important with you. It’s not
  bad news, but it may be a surprise! To be completely honest, even now I’m not
  quite sure how to tell people this, so thanks in advance for listening.


  I hope it’s pretty clear both personally and professionally that I take
  diversity and inclusion seriously, and that’s been the case for a very long
  time. Back when I was in ROTC in college, it was stressed to us that diversity
  is an asset that makes groups better. I took that lesson to heart back then,
  and my belief has only gotten stronger as the years have passed. Given
  politics lately, I've been more vocal about that and it's also forced me to
  take an accounting of myself as well.


  The thing is, I’ve known I was different in some way since I was a kid. Over
  the last thirty or so years, I think I’ve finally figured out what those
  feelings mean: I’m transgender. Although I was assigned male at birth, I
  identify as female. Boom. So what do I do about it?


  To get some facts out of the way, I’ve been seeing a therapist for about three
  years to work through this. I started taking hormone replacement therapy
  (estrogen) in June of 2016. Since then I’ve slowly explored that part of
  myself and come out to a majority of my family and friends.


  In early October of last year, I decided that I couldn't honestly support and
  value other people's diversity, and I mean truly support it, unless I was
  honest about who I am. So after talking with Lindsey, I came out and
  transitioned at work. Since then I've basically been living as my real self
  100% of the time.


  None of those things have been decisions that I’ve taken lightly or without
  due consideration. I can’t imagine anyone would go through this unless they
  felt they had to in order to be happy.


  You might be thinking, okay, cool Shea, but what does that mean for me? Check
  out this handy dandy list of questions and answers I put together:

  Please feel free to message me or call or hang out and ask me questions. From
  my experiences coming out to people so far, I’ve seen that it’s very hard to
  understand what it’s like to feel transgender unless you’ve lived it yourself.
  After all, I don’t know what it’s like to not feel this way. However, I have
  seen that open dialog helps. I appreciate the questions very much, and I’ll do
  my best to answer them in a way that makes sense.


  Another thing: it’s going to be hard to completely avoid some awkward moments,
  but that’s really the last thing I want. Although your perception of me will
  change, I’m still the same person. I also understand that people may have
  their own opinions on this topic. I can’t change that, and that’s okay. I hope
  we can get by on mutual respect and love as friends if that's the case.


  Alright, I’ve rambled long enough, so I’ll end with this: I think people can
  sense when you’re being authentic. As a part of this journey, I’ve finally had
  a chance to do that, and my heart is full. I’ve never felt so much love from
  so many people in my life, ever. That is truly a wonderful thing and I
  wouldn't change it for the world!
